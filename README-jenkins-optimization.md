# Jenkins Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides instructions for optimizing your Jenkins server performance.

## Common Jenkins Performance Issues

1. **Insufficient Resources**: Jenkins running with default Docker settings
2. **Pipeline Inefficiencies**: Sequential stages that could run in parallel
3. **Build History Accumulation**: Old builds consuming disk space
4. **Plugin Overload**: Too many or poorly performing plugins
5. **Memory Leaks**: Long-running Jenkins instances without restarts

## Optimization Steps Implemented

### 1. Resource Allocation Optimization

The new configuration allocates more resources to Jenkins:
- Memory: 3GB with 6GB swap
- CPU: Higher priority with 2048 CPU shares
- JVM settings: `-Xmx2g -Xms1g -XX:MaxPermSize=512m`
- Using JDK 17 for better performance

### 2. Pipeline Optimization

The optimized Jenkinsfile includes:
- Parallel execution of build and analysis stages
- Combined Docker build and push stages
- Reduced timeout for quality gate (10 minutes instead of 1 hour)
- Added pipeline options for better resource management
- Workspace cleanup before and after builds

### 3. Maintenance Automation

Added maintenance scripts to:
- Clean up old builds (older than 7 days)
- Clear workspaces after builds
- Schedule weekly Jenkins restarts
- Prune Docker resources after pipeline runs

### 4. Plugin Management

Added installation of performance-focused plugins:
- Performance Plugin: For monitoring build performance
- Disk Usage Plugin: For tracking disk space
- Timestamper: For better build logs
- Pipeline Utility Steps: For optimized pipeline operations

## How to Apply These Optimizations

1. Run the Jenkins optimization playbook:
   ```
   cd /Users/wole/project5-devops/ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventory jenkins_optimize.yml
   ```

2. Replace your existing Jenkinsfile with the optimized version:
   ```
   cp /Users/wole/project5-devops/Jenkinsfile.optimized /Users/wole/project5-devops/Jenkinsfile
   ```

3. Monitor Jenkins performance after these changes

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider Scaling**: If workload increases, consider setting up Jenkins agents
2. **Pipeline as Code Best Practices**: 
   - Keep pipelines simple and focused
   - Use shared libraries for common functionality
   - Implement caching for dependencies

3. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Review and remove unused plugins
   - Monitor disk usage regularly
   - Update Jenkins and plugins to latest versions

4. **Infrastructure Considerations**:
   - Ensure EC2 instance has sufficient resources (consider t3.medium or larger)
   - Use EBS volumes with provisioned IOPS for better I/O performance
   - Consider using AWS EFS for shared storage if using multiple agents
